# Hate Crime Analysis in the US from 2015 to 2019
## Background
At the federal level, a [hate crime](https://www.justice.gov/hatecrimes/learn-about-hate-crimes) is defined as "a crime motivated by bias against race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or disability". According to the [hate crime statistics report](https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2019/topic-pages/incidents-and-offenses) published by FBI, hate crimes have rose to a new high level since a decade ago due to the increasing racial tension and the current pandemic. Although fewer than 10,000 hate crimes are reported each year, it is estimated that at least 250,000 hate crimes were commited [each year](https://www.justice.gov/hatecrimes/learn-about-hate-crimes). Hate crimes affect many people in the United States everyday, with racially motivated hate crimes being the most prominant. It is therefore important to come up with measures and policy to mitigate hate crimes in the US. We will be looking at the dataset published by the [FBI](https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime) from 2015 to 2019 and specifically analyze the trend of racially motivated hate crimes.
